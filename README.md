# Schabernaq's / ChrizMas' CS:GO config

More and more people ask me for my CS:GO settings. So, here you will be served!

Just put the **autoexec.cfg** into your `..\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` and **video.txt** into your `Steam\userdata\<YOUR_USER_ID>\730\local\cfg` folder and you are ready to go.

Feel free to add or edit any params you need to your own autoexec.
